#Sentiment Mining with Twitter

We used Twitter data dumps to tag each tweet containing emoticons as an emotion and thence build a general-purpose sentiment tagging system, even when the text does not contain an emoticon.

In essence, the training data, derived from twitter contained emoticons, which acted as labels. Python nltk was used for the processing.
